###-Three types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning
###- The main goal in supervised learning is to learn a model from labeled training data that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data. The term supervised refers to a set of samples where the desired output signals (labels) are already known.

**Day 4 of 60-Day Challenge**
###- Classification is a subcategory of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances, based on past observations. Those class labels are discrete, unordered values that can be understood as the group membership of the instances. Set of class labels does not have to be binary, it could also be multi class classification (e.g. handwritten character classification).
###- A second type of supervised learning is the prediction of continuous outcomes, which is also called regression analysis. In regression analysis, we are given a number of predictors (explanatory) variables and a continuous response variable (outcome or target), and we try to find a relationship between those variables that allows us to predict an outcome.
###- Another type of ML is reinforcement learning, which has a goal to develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based on interactions with the environment. Since the information about the current state of the environment typically also includes a so-called reward signal, we can think of RL as a field related to supervised learning. However, in RL this feedback is not the correct ground truth label or value, but a measure of how well the action was measured by a reward function. An agent can use RL to learn a series of actions that maximizes this reward via an exploratory trial-and-error approach or deliberative planning. e.g. self-driving cars.
